The [mockup][3] page was shown to JW and she approved of the layout as well as the visual effect. JW mentioned there was a change to the logo and that she would send JR the latest revision.

With regards to headings, JW discussed with JR a [page of headings and links][2]

JR agreed to build a wireframe of the site to help identify the actual pages used, as well as how the visitor will nagivate the site. JR also agreed to create a 2nd mockup to include the secondary menu.
